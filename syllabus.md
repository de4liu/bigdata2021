## 1. INTRODUCTION

This course provides an introduction to big data concepts, environments, processes, and tools from the perspective of business analysts. It uses a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach to develop an understanding of major elements of the big data ecosystems such as Hadoop, MapReduce, Scoop, Hive, and Spark, with a focus on their value propositions and how they can be used to solve data science problems at scale. Through this course, you will also gain an understanding of major concepts in cloud computing, and become familiar with the big data offerings of a leading cloud computing platform -- Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Because the topics covered in this course are nascent and evolving quickly, students are expected to engage in active learning through troubleshooting, experimentation, proactive researching, and sharing (via Slack).

## 2. LEARNING OBJECTIVES

This course has two main categories of objectives.

1. Develop an understanding of the big data ecosystem, the kinds of problems it aims to solve, the characteristics of big data technologies, and their key advantages and disadvantages. Such an understanding allows you to recognize the opportunities and challenges associated with big data, from both business and technological perspectives, and to guide businesses in adopting and using big data technologies.
2. Develop core competencies in using a variety of essentially big data tools (such as Scoop, Hive, Spark, and Cloud computing) and processes to solve data science problems at scale.

## 3. PREREQUISITES

This course is built on a sequence of courses offered in the MSBA program including Python programming (MSBA 6310) and database management (MSBA 6320, which is offered in parallel). As prerequisites for this course, students are expected to:

- Have a basic knowledge of computing systems (operating system, file systems, www, etc).
- Have working knowledge of SQL and relational databases.
  - Those who lack knowledge of SQL and relational databases are advised to learn from many available resources, such as the [SQL essential training on Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/SQL-tutorials/SQL-Essential-Training/139988-2.html).
- Have working knowledge of Python.
  - Parts of course will leverage Python scripts, though extensive Python programming is not the focus of this course. If you have not been exposed to these programming languages before, there are many free introductory online courses on Python (e.g. the Python course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and [Introduction for Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) from DataCamp).

The following are also helpful to know:

- Basic knowledge of computers (operating systems, file systems, etc).
- Some familiarity with the command-line interface (CLI) and Linux operating systems.
- Some understanding of machine learning methods, e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means clustering.

## 4. TEXTBOOK

We do not have a required text for this course. Instead, we rely on our lecture slides, lab notes, additional reading materials (articles & book chapters). 

## 5. SOFTWARE &amp; HARDWARE

Most of the software used for this course is pre-installed on servers that we provide in Amazon's AWS cloud (our first time to use this highly efficient, scalable infrastructure). As a backup, we will also provide an MSBA virtual desktop that runs a Virtual Machine (VM) that has the necessary software and data. 

- **Hadoop/Hive**: We use the Cloudera Virtual Machine installed on course provision servers. The servers (depending on the instance) pre-installs big data tools such as Hadoop, MapReduce, Sqoop, Hive, Spark, and some of the datasets used for this course. 

- **Spark**: We will use the DataBricks community edition (https://databricks.com/try-databricks) for the Spark portion of the course work. The DataBricks community edition provides a free service for a limited (6GB RAM) virtual machine hosted on AWS. Besides, you may have two other choices, including using the course provisioned server or installing Apache Spark on your computer from [https://github.com/paulovn/ml-vm-notebook](https://github.com/paulovn/ml-vm-notebook). 

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. (Tentative) Through the amazon academic partner program, you can obtain a **$100 certificate** for use with AWS. This will be needed for the cloud computing part of the labs and assignment (but not for the exam), and possibly for your team project. More details to come. Additionally, you may also try Microsoft Azure/Google Cloud for yourself.  

## 6. GRADING

Your grade will be based on the following activities (tentative):

| **Activity** | **Grade %** |
| --- | --- |
| Team Project | 15% |
| Homework Assignments (7) | 21%, 3% each |
| Self-assessment quizzes | 10% |
| Lab completion | 5% |
| Participation | 2% |
| Midterm Exam | 22% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

A final letter grade is given according to the following scale.

| % | Grade | % | Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 93.0 or above | A | 77.0 - 79.9 | C+ |
| 90.0 - 92.9 | A- | 73.0 - 76.9 | C |
| 87.0 - 89.9 | B+ | 70.0 - 72.9 | C- |
| 83.0 - 86.9 | B | 60.0 - 69.9 | D |
| 80.0 - 82.9 | B- | Below 60.0 | F |

Though it rarely happens, this scale may be adjusted to ensure compliance with MSBA grading policies, which requires the class median GPA of 3.3 +/- 0.2.

## 6.1 Participation credits

You can earn participation credits by:

- Assignment-based participation activities: **1.5% of course grade**
    - completing surveys on time 
    - completing participation assignments (e.g. submit a self-introduction video)
- sharing big-data related news, articles, and questions in the **#bigdata-news-articles channel**; posting comments to articles shared in the **#bigdata-news-articles channel**: **0.5% course grade**. The tentative grading scheme is as follows:
    + a post of at least 20 words in the **#bigdata-news-articles channel**: 10 points
    + a comment of at least 5 words in the **#bigdata-news-articles channel**: 2 points
    + you will receive the full 0.5% course grade if you reach 20 points.
    + Only your **first post** at a given day will receive points
    + only your **first 3 comments** at a given day will receive points
    + contribution at the end of the semester may be cut off, so do not wait till the last minute to post articles/comments.
    + Instructor reserves the right to change Slack participation grading scheme (notice will be given).

Instructor reserves the right to adjust participation credits based on subjective evaluation of student participation: e.g., Zoom participation, quality of slack contribution, slack contribution in other channels, etc.

## 7. HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS

### 7.1 Homework Academic Integrity

**All homework assignments are INDIVIDUAL assignments**. Plagiarism is prohibited and will be penalized. You may still discuss the homework problems with fellow students. **However, no documents or fragments of homework should be shared between students, physically or digitally (a rule of thumb is that you "typed it with your own hands".** Sharing homework papers is strictly forbidden and is considered plagiarism, and both the one who shared and the one who received can face a penalty, including zero grade for the assignment, letter grade downgrade, and an "F" for the course. All scholarly dishonesty incidence will be reported to the University's [Office of Community Standards](https://communitystandards.umn.edu/address-misconduct/responding-scholastic-dishonesty). In case of difficulty with homework assignments, please reach out to the instructor as early as possible.

Citing someone else's work (including those from the Internet) without accrediting the source properly is also considered plagiarism. **You must precisely point out which part of your answer refer a source and include a reference to the source.** Refer to our submission guidelines for more homework related instructions.

### 7.2 Late Policy - Flex Days

**You have 5 flex days** that you may use at your discretion to defer the due date of a homework assignment or self-assessment quizzes (a set of self-assessments due on the same day is considered one "assignment"). You must use your flex days in the whole day (24 hours) increments. You can defer a single assignment by **a maximum of 2 days**. 

You do not need to notify us if you want to use your flex days on homework or self-assessment quizzes! Submit your homework/self-assessment quizzes when ready and the proper number of flex days will be deducted. If you do not want to use your flex days on a certain assignment, please let the TA know. 

Flex days are intended to be used for unforeseen circumstances such as technical difficulties, family emergencies, and personal illness. **After your flex days have been used for the semester, late work will not be accepted and will earn no credit (0 points)**.

### 7.3 Miscellaneous 

If you have not used Canvas assignments before, please watch the [tutorial videos here](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3891-canvas-video-guide#jive_content_id_Students). 

You should always save a copy of your submitted work, including homework, team projects, and the exams. Store the copy in a secure location (such as your Google Drive).

Homework assignments are usually graded within one week of the due date. Homework is graded on a scale of 0 to 10. If you get 10, you will receive the full 3% credit. If you get 9, you will receive the 2.7% credit, and so on. The instructor reserves the right to give extra credits for exceptional work.

## 8. TEAM PROJECT

The team project is evaluated by your peers (50%) and by the instructor (50%). The team project is generally evaluated along the lines of value, presentation, rigor, and creativity. While in general every team member receives the same credit, those who lack contribution (as reflected by peer evaluation within the group) may receive partial to zero credit. For detailed guidelines about team projects, please see the team assignment handout. 

## 9. Instructional Technologies Used in the Course

### Slack - Discussion forum

We use the Slack to:

- general purpose interaction/discuss, voice calls (if needed)
- discuss administrative/technical issues
- discuss issues related to labs/homework assignments
    - **If the issue applies to you specifically**, please use a private channel to share with the instructor
    - **If the issue cloud impact many students**, you can share it in public channels (we have separate areas for each Homework)
- students and faculty to share course Internet resources (news, articles, etc)
    - you should include a link to the source and your commentary/expert of the article.

Participation can take many forms; Posting questions, posting replies, and reacting to others' posts are all desirable forms of participation. You're encouraged to give frequent feedback to others (likes and comments) and stay constructive.

### FlipGrid - Video Sharing

- We use this for sharing short videos (e.g., self introduction). 
- Some participation assignments may be Flipgrid-based.

It is available as a Canvas plug in (accessible from the menu).

### VoiceThread - Voice Presentation

We use voice thread for recording a team presentation collaboratively. More details will be forthcoming.

### Zoom

We use zoom for synchronous meetings & office hours. 


## 10. OTHER RESOURCES

### Getting Help

Slack is the best way to reach the instructor. If you have a technical problem, please attach the scripts, screen-shot, error message if any. Appointments are also welcome. For general technical problems concerning user accounts, hardware, or software, you may contact the  [OIT Help Desk](http://goo.gl/pjMh1K).

### Academic Integrity and Scholastic Dishonesty

Academic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in University courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. Failure to do so by seeking an unfair advantage over others or misrepresenting someone else's work as your own, can result in disciplinary action. The University  [defines scholastic dishonesty](http://goo.gl/uGwSbg)  as follows:

_Scholastic Dishonesty: Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis._

Within this course, a student responsible for scholastic dishonesty can be assigned a penalty up to and including an F or N for the course. If you have any questions regarding the expectations for a specific assignment or exam, please ask.

### Students with Disabilities

The University of Minnesota is committed to providing all students equal access to learning opportunities. Disability Services is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. Students registered with Disability Services, who have a letter requesting accommodations, are encouraged to contact the instructor early in the semester. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g. psychiatric, attentional, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or systemic), are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at 612 626 1333 (V/TTY) or at ds@umn.edu. Additional information is available on the DS website  [http://ds.umn.edu](http://goo.gl/KELhZ7).

### Tennessen Warning Notice Pursuant to MN Department of Administration’s Data Practices

To make this class more accessible to all enrolled students, we intend to record all class lectures and discussions. Since your audio/video may be part of those recordings we are informing you. Along with the instructor and teaching assistants, these recordings will be shared with only the students enrolled in the class during this semester, in accordance with FERPA regulations.
